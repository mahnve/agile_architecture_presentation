Asking yourself "How will I replace this system" will help you design better

"The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to _reason
about_ the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and
properties of both. [1] The term also refers to documentation of a system's
software architecture. _Documenting_ software architecture facilitates
communication between _stakeholders_ , documents _early_ decisions about high-level
design, and allows _reuse_ of design components and patterns between projects"
