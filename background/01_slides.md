The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason
about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and
properties of both. [1] The term also refers to documentation of a system's
software architecture. Documenting software architecture facilitates
communication between stakeholders, documents early decisions about high-level
design, and allows reuse of design components and patterns between projects
